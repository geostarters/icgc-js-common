A Javascript lib with common functionalities to use across different projects.

## <a name="install"></a>INSTALLATION

```
npm i --save @geostarters/common
```

## USAGE

Usage with ES6 modules:
``` js
import * as ICGCCommon from " @geostarters/common";
```

Usage with Commonjs:
``` js
const Utils =  require("@geostarters/common");
```


Besides it,  it is generated a single file package and its .map, using [browserify](http://browserify.org/):

  **dist/ICGCCommon.js**

  **dist/ICGCCommon.map.js**

## Environment

* Uses [documentation.js](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation) to generate a JSON file to be consumed by another package (see the [documenting the code](#documentation) section) (TODO: Ingest it with [@mapbox/batfish](https://github.com/mapbox/batfish)?)
* Uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to perform static analysis in code
* Uses [flow](https://flow.org/) to check types (see the [using types](#types) section)
* Uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing (see the [writting tests](#testing) section)


## <a name="documentation"></a>Documenting the code
The documentation follows the [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html) syntax. 

To get started you can read the documentation.js start guide [here](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) or take a look at the provided example file [here](https://github.com/geostarters/js-project-template/blob/master/src/geo/latlon.js)

## <a name="types"></a>Using types
Using flow provides a way to check for common syntax errors while calling functions. Flow provides a simple example of which kind of problems it can solve in their [Type Annotations guide](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/). There's also a list of annotations it supports there.

## <a name="testing"></a>Writting tests

* The project uses JEST.
* **test** folder included
  

## Provided scripts

* __build-dev__: Creates a single file package with all the assertions intact to be ussed in browsers. 
* __watch-dev__: Watches the source
* __build-min__: Creates a minified package with its map file and without assertions to be ussed in browsers
* __build-unflow__: Builds ready-to-use modules in dist by removing flow types
* __build-react__: Builds ready-to-use es modules in dist/es by removing flow types
* __build-modules__: Builds ready-to-use commonjs modules in dist/commonjs
* __build-docs__: Generates the documentation file
* __lint__: Checks the code linting
* __lint-docs__: Lints the documentation files
* __test__: Runs the static type checker and runs the tests
* __test:unit__: Runs the unit tests
* __test-flow__: Runs the static type checks
* __test-cov__: Runs the testing coverage


## Folder structure

__dist:__ Contains the built files generated by the scripts (dev package, minified package and map, commonjs folder and es folder)

__src:__ Contains an index file that requires all the modules that should be exported and all the source files that compound the package.

__test:__ Contains the unit and integration tests
